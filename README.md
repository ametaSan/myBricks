A  simple try to learn the basic of unity.

It's very simply designed to shoot bricks and obtain points.


...

up, down, left, right - moving the camera

spacebar - shooting a ball

Esc - instructions

...

The player list contents some of my favorite songs.

...

It's an too old project (2018) for me to well remember other features...

...

The recommend resolution is 1280*720, and sorry for the full Chinese.

The footages such as images, music and sounds are all downloaded from the Internet. 



===new branch===

I found a updated version of this game made by me in... about 2019?

Some behavior controls are added to the bricks.

There is another scene of a simple demo. I haven't split it as a brand new project. 

I haven't hand on it a long time... You may have a look if interested.
